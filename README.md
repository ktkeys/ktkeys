 Hi, Iâ€™m Kati ðŸ‘‹
I'm a long time IT engineer making the switch into Software Development

I worked for a decade supporting IT infrastructures and MSPs before going back to school and getting my bachelors in Software Development with an emphasis on Java. 

Real world experience includes SQL, Cisco Networking, Cisco UC, Palo Altos, Windows Server, Linux, VMWare, ScienceLogic, ServiceNow, Netbrain. 

I've taken courses on Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Python, Java, HTML, CSS & UI Design. 

I'm excited to put this knowledge to work in the real world.

Outside of the techy stuff - I'm a digital nomad :earth_americas:, travelling around the U.S with my truck, camper and most important, my fur baby :dog: 
I love to read & write and am teaching myself to paint as well - I feel like it's important to have a creative outlet with such a technical job and a definite stress reducer. 
I also love pretty much anything outdoors, hiking, kayaking, paddleboarding, my dog even loves to come on the SUP with me :)
