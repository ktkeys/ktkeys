- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ktkeys
- I'm a long time IT engineer :computer:	and entry level coder :keyboard:	.  
- After a decade of working on IT infrastructure, hoping to make the leap to Software Development :clap:	
- My software development degree was focused mainly on Java with some HTML, CSS, & UI Design in the middle.

Outside of the techy stuff - I'm a digital nomad :earth_americas:, travelling around the U.S with my truck :pickup_truck:	and camper and most important, my fur baby :dog: 
I love to read & write and am teaching myself to paint as well - I feel like it's important to have a creative outlet with such a technical job and a definite stress reducer. 
I also love pretty much anything outdoors, hiking, kayaking, paddleboarding, my dog even loves to come on the SUP with me :)
